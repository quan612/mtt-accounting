**As of September 27, 2020, there are some temporary changes to the EI program to help you access EI benefits. These changes will be in effect for 1 year. Go to EI benefits and leave to find the benefit type that applies to your situation. The following changes could apply to you:**

- A minimum unemployment rate of 13.1% applies to all regions across Canada starting August 9, 2020

- If your region’s unemployment rate is higher than 13.1%, we’ll use the higher actual rate to calculate your benefits

- You only need 120 insured hours to qualify for benefits because you’ll receive a one-time credit of:

- 300 insured hours if you’re applying for regular benefits

- 480 insured hours if you’re applying for sickness, maternity, parental or caregiving benefits

- You’ll receive at least $500 per week before taxes, or $300 per week before taxes for extended parental benefits but you could receive more

- If you’re applying for sickness benefits, you do not need to submit a medical certificate

- If you’re a fisher, we’ll look at the earnings from your 2018, 2019 and 2020 summer or winter seasons to determine your benefit rate and establish your claim for the same season

- If you received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), the 52-week period to accumulate insured hours will be extended
